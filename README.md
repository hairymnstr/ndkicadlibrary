KiCad library files
===================

This is my copy of the KiCad libraries much modified from a very old branch of the official
libraries.  Unless you are trying to use one of my projects I advise you check out 
<http://www.kicad.org/libraries/download/>.  All library files here are free to use at your own
risk, many of them are not mine.

There are also a number of scripts for automating output of gerbers and schematics in the scripts
folder.  These are generally BSD-2-clause licensed for use in any project personal or commercial,
some are Apache licensed based on older work by someone else, generally still free to use.
